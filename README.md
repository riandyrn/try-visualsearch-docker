# Try Visual Search

This is runnable version of `https://github.com/ThomasDelteil/VisualSearch_MXNet` with latest `MXNet Model Server` on Docker.

This project is my learning notes towards the project. Hopefully it would help other beginners like me to get started.

There are several `make` functions in this repo:

- `build` => build up the model then the the docker image
- `run` => to run the container from the built docker image
- `stop` => stop currently running docker container
- `test` => run sample inference test using `kitten.jpg`

Feel free to contact me if you found any issues. I just wish to make it easy for other beginners like me to get started learning the project.
